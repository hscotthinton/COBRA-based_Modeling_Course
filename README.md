# Course Description
The purpose of this course is to learn the basics of constraint-based metabolic cellular modeling and analysis, a subset of the larger world of systems biology. This course will focus on developing the programming skills to be able to interrogate cell models and develop new strains. It will focus on pragmatic skills.

# Course Objectives
By the end of this course, you will be able to:

1. Explain flux balance analysis
2. Explain the basic E.coli core metabolic model
3. Demonstrate the ability to effectively use the COBRApy Toolbox
4. Explain and demonstrate flux variability analysis
5. Explain and demonstrate randomized sampling
6. Explain and demonstrate model interrogation
7. Explain and demonstrate the model creation and enhancement
8. Explain and demonstrate production envelopes
9. Explain and demonstrate gene/reaction knockout strategies
10. Explain and demonstrate gene/reaction modulation
11. Explain and demonstrate strain design
